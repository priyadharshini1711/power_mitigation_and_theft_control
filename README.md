## General Information
- This project is used to identify the power theft in domestic usage.
- It solves the major problem of short circuit, power theft and power consumption in the domestic power supply.
- This nwas built as a part of 36 hour hackathon conducted in a institution.


## Technologies Used
- Arduino UNO
- C
- PHP
- MySQL
- Google Charts
- HTML, CSS, JS


## Features
- The consumer can register using their details.
- The power usages is captured at every interval of time in the power_usage table.
- The user can view their power consumption and mitigation status.
- Admin can view the stats of overall consumption and mitigation status of the power usage.
- The power reading is calculated automatically based on the usage and distribution.
